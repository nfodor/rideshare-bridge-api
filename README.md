# Rideshare Blockchain Bridge API

This repository contains the **complete implementation** of a standalone blockchain-based **Bridge API** designed for rideshare platforms. It allows platforms to **offload payments, escrow management, and referral incentives** to a secure, self-hosted blockchain layer.

## 🔥 Project Goal

Build a **secure, modular, and self-contained payment bridge** that:
- Handles escrow-based ride payments on-chain
- Supports milestone-based release (e.g. ride started, completed)
- Allows cancellation handling and lost item fee logic
- Issues referral rewards for early drivers and riders
- Is fully testable locally and testnet-ready
- Keeps wallet logic **fully decoupled** from the main rideshare app

This is part of a broader effort to support **independent rideshare networks** and empower drivers by giving them control over payment flows while ensuring platform-level integrity.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Start with Docker
docker-compose up
```

## 🔧 Integration Guide

### ⚠️ Critical: Update Before Each Test Session

**Before running any tests or integration work, you MUST update the codebase to ensure compatibility:**

```bash
# 1. Update dependencies
npm install

# 2. Verify server starts correctly
npm run dev

# 3. Test basic endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/pool/status

# 4. Run test suite to verify functionality
npm test
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Dependencies may have security updates
- API endpoints may have been modified
- Test data structures could have changed
- Blockchain integration libraries evolve rapidly

## 🛡️ How the Insurance System Works

The insurance system provides comprehensive ride protection through a multi-layered approach combining AI analysis, community validation, and automated payouts.

### 🔄 Insurance Workflow

```
1. Quote Generation    2. Policy Purchase    3. Claims Processing    4. Community Review    5. Automated Payout
      ↓                      ↓                      ↓                      ↓                     ↓
 Risk Assessment  →  Premium Payment  →  AI Fraud Analysis  →  Jury Validation  →  Multi-Trigger Release
```

### 💰 Dynamic Premium Calculation

**Base Premium**: 2% of ride amount
**Risk Multipliers Applied**:
- **Safety Score** (0.5x - 2.0x): Higher safety scores get better rates
- **Experience Level** (0.7x - 1.5x): More rides = lower premiums  
- **Real-time Factors**: Weather, traffic, time of day, route risk
- **Claim History**: Previous claims increase premiums
- **Pool Loyalty**: Long-term contributors get discounts

**Example Calculation**:
```javascript
// $25.50 ride with good driver (safety score: 850)
basePremium = $25.50 × 0.02 = $0.51
safetyMultiplier = 0.5 (50% discount for high safety)
finalPremium = $0.51 × 0.5 = $0.26 (1.02% of ride cost)
```

### 🤖 AI Fraud Detection Engine

**15+ Risk Factors Analyzed**:
- **Document Integrity**: Metadata analysis, OCR confidence, edit detection
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Claim frequency, amount patterns, reporting delays
- **External Validation**: Police reports, medical records, weather conditions
- **Network Analysis**: Collusion detection, social connections, device fingerprinting
- **Geographic Analysis**: Location consistency, route realism, operating areas

**Fraud Score Calculation**:
```javascript
fraudScore = Σ(riskFactor × weight)
// 0.0 = No fraud indicators
// 1.0 = Maximum fraud probability

// Example: 23% fraud score = Low-moderate risk
riskFactors = {
  documentIntegrity: 0.1,    // Weight: 20%
  claimFrequency: 0.1,       // Weight: 15%
  reportingDelay: 0.4,       // Weight: 8% 
  // ... 12 more factors
}
```

### ⚖️ Community Validation System

**Driver Jury Eligibility**:
- Safety Score ≥ 750
- Total Rides ≥ 500
- Clean Accident History
- Active Validator Status

**Consensus Mechanism**:
- **Quorum**: 66% of assigned jurors must vote
- **Approval**: 51% must vote to approve claim
- **Reputation Impact**: Accurate votes increase reputation, incorrect votes decrease it

**Validator Staking**:
- **Minimum Stake**: 1,000 tokens
- **Slashing**: 10% penalty for malicious behavior
- **Reputation Scoring**: 0-1000 scale affects eligibility

### 💸 Automated Payout System

**Multi-Trigger Execution**:

1. **AI Auto-Approval** (< $1K claims, < 30% fraud score)
   - Processing Time: 1 hour
   - Confidence: 95%+

2. **Community Consensus** (Most claims)
   - Processing Time: 24-48 hours
   - Requires 66%+ jury approval

3. **Manual Review** (High-value or high-risk claims)
   - Processing Time: 7-14 days
   - Human oversight required

4. **Emergency Override** (Crisis situations)
   - Processing Time: Immediate
   - Special authorization required

### 🚨 Emergency Fund Management

**Crisis Detection**:
- Pool utilization > 80%
- Mass claim events (50+ claims/day)
- Liquidity shortfall < 10% reserves

**Emergency Protocols**:
- **Emergency Fund**: $1M reserve for crisis situations
- **Automatic Activation**: When crisis conditions detected
- **Enhanced Validation**: Stricter claim requirements during emergencies
- **Priority Processing**: Life-threatening claims processed first

### 🐛 Integration Troubleshooting

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **Tests Failing After Update**
   ```bash
   # Clear node_modules and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   npm test
   ```

2. **Invalid Ethereum Addresses**
   ```bash
   # Addresses must be exactly 42 characters: 0x + 40 hex characters
   # Valid: 0x742d35Cc6e2c5e12A2B2C7b8B4F3E8A1F2c3d4e5
   # Invalid: 0x742d35Cc6e2c5e12 (too short)
   ```

3. **Signature Validation Issues**
   ```bash
   # Our mock signatures will fail real validation
   # This is expected behavior for security
   # Use ethers.js to generate real signatures for production
   ```

4. **Port Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Change port in package.json or use environment variable
   PORT=3001 npm run dev
   ```
